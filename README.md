# Dragon's Breath #

A MacOS X menu bar notifier for 
[Dragon Go Server](http://www.dragongoserver.net/) messages.

## Features ##

* Shows a menu bar indicator when you have moves to make (similar to the
  Twitter app's blue bird, but with a mini Go board and no blue).
* Supports [Growl](http://growl.info/) notifications for new messages.
* Refreshes every five minutes (rather than once an hour, which is the delay
  for DGS email notifications), or whenever you ask for a refresh. Use less
  time for each move!
* Lets you jump directly to the game page for a waiting move.
* Launches automatically on login.
* Provides shortcuts to other commonly-visited DGS pages.

## Status ##

The app is now fully functional. If you'd like to give it a try, you can
[download v0.1.1](https://github.com/downloads/precipice/Dragon-s-Breath/Dragon-s-Breath-v0.1.1.zip),
drop it in your Applications folder, and run it. Feedback would be great.
