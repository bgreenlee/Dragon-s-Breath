# Dragon's Breath #

A MacOS X menu bar notifier for 
[Dragon Go Server](http://www.dragongoserver.net/) messages.

## Features ##

* Shows a menu bar indicator when you have moves to make (similar to the
  Twitter app's blue bird).
* Supports Growl notifications for new messages.
* Refreshes every five minutes (rather than once an hour, which is the delay
  for DGS email notifications), or whenever you ask for a refresh.
* Keeps track of which games you've looked at, and turns off the indicator
  once you've looked at all of those awaiting moves (until a new move is
  needed).
* Lets you jump directly to the game page for a waiting move.
* Checks for new moves as soon as your computer wakes from sleep.
* Provides shortcuts to other commonly-visited DGS pages.

## Status ##

The app is now fully functional, but hasn't been tested by anyone but me.
I'll make a binary build and post it.
